# **Goose**

The link to my completed project is [Goose](https://mistergoose.netlify.app).

Goose is a place for people to be able to share their ideas and interact with others who may or may not feel the same. There are so many facebook groups dedicated to allowing strangers with similar interests interact and I wanted to created a website that allowed the same in a more streamlined manner.

You are able to browse the content of the website without logging in. This content consists of topics (essentially categories) and the posts that are sorted into those topics. Upon hovering over topics, you should see a dropdown that includes the list of all of the available topics. If you would like more details on each topic, you can click the link to see all topics. Upon hovering on a topic, you should see a description of that topic. Please create an account either via email or Facebook/google to access the other features.

Upon logging in, you should notice that there are a couple of new links in the **navbar**: projects, add new, and profile. Hovering over the profile icon will show you links to your profile, your posts, all users, users you follow, and the chat. Honk Chat is a place where you can chat with everyone registered to the site. It allows people who may not be as certain about their ideas to still interact with others and be able to better formulate a response.

When you first login, you will be directed to an empty page that will later contain the list of projects from the people you follow. The page will prompt you (with links) to follow people either from the list of all users or the list of all projects. Please try creating a new topic and/or project via the dropdown button or the dropdown menu in the navbar.

Users can:

<ul>
<li>login</li>
<li>create topics</li>
<li>create posts</>
<li>chat</>
</ul>
